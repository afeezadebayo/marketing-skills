Use whenever someone asks how to get cited by ChatGPT, Perplexity or AI Overviews, how to write for AI search, what GEO content looks like, why a ranking page isn't cited, or how to make content more citable."

# Answer-Ready Content for AI Search

When an AI engine builds an answer, it retrieves passages and decides which ones to use and credit. Pages that get cited tend to say something specific and checkable, in a passage that makes sense on its own, from a source the engine has reason to trust. Pages that restate common knowledge give the engine nothing it couldn't write itself.

This skill audits and rewrites pages so they are worth citing: original, specific, well organised and accurate, without the myths that waste time.

## What the evidence says
| Finding | Source | Label |
|---|---|---|
| Unique, non-commodity content with first-hand experience matters most for Google's AI features | Google Search Central guide to generative AI features, 2026 | Confirmed |
| Chunking content or rewriting it just for AI isn't required; there's no ideal page length | Same guide | Confirmed |
| Structured data isn't required for AI features and there's no special markup | Same guide | Confirmed |
| Adding citations, quotations and statistics raised visibility in generative answers by up to about 40% on a research benchmark | Aggarwal et al., GEO, KDD 2024 | Research finding, not tested on live engines |
| Clear, self-contained sections are easier for retrieval systems to use | Practitioner studies | Consensus |

## Operating principles
1. **Non-commodity first.** Google contrasts "7 Tips for First-Time Homebuyers" with a first-hand account of waiving an inspection; the second is the kind of content AI systems value. [Confirmed] Bring data, cases, tests and opinions only you can provide.
2. **Answer, then expand.** Put the direct answer under the heading that asks the question, then give the detail.
3. **Make facts checkable.** Every figure has a source and date; every claim can be traced.
4. **Write for people.** Organisation that helps readers (headings, short paragraphs, tables, images) also helps retrieval. Don't write strangely "for the AI".
5. **Keep it current.** Engines value fresh information for time-sensitive topics; dated facts get you cited wrongly.

## When to use, and when not to
Use it for pages that rank but aren't cited, pages that matter for buyer questions, comparison and pricing pages, definitions in your field, and before publishing new guides.

Don't use it to fix access or rendering (use `ai-crawler-access`), to plan which questions to answer (use `query-fan-out-mapping`) or for classic on-page SEO alone (use the Content SEO skills).

## Inputs to ask for, in one message
1. The pages and the prompts or sub-queries they should answer.
2. Which sources AI engines currently cite for those prompts.
3. First-hand material: data, screenshots, case results, expert notes, test results.
4. Brand voice and the facts that must be accurate (prices, features, regulation).

## Workflow

### Step 1. Compare with what gets cited
Read the pages engines cite for your prompts. Note what they offer: a clear definition, a table, original data, a named expert, a recent date.

### Step 2. Find the commodity sections
Mark every section that only restates common knowledge. Either replace it with something original or cut it.

### Step 3. Add answer passages
Under each question-style heading, write a 40 to 80 word direct answer that stands alone: it names the subject, gives the answer and one supporting fact. Then expand.

### Step 4. Add evidence
- Statistics with source, sample and date.
- Short quotes from named experts with roles.
- Original data: surveys, usage data, test results, benchmarks.
- Worked examples and screenshots with capture dates.

### Step 5. Structure for scanning
Descriptive headings, comparison tables in HTML, step lists for processes, definitions near the top. Keep key facts in text, not only in images.

### Step 6. Make the entity explicit
Name the brand, product and author in context ("In our 2026 survey of 400 finance teams..."), so passages carry attribution when lifted.

### Step 7. Check accuracy and freshness
Verify every fact. Add "last updated" with real changes. Remove contradictory older pages or redirect them.

## Passage patterns that work
| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| Definition | "Payroll compliance is ... It covers ... In the UK, employers must ..." |
| Direct comparison | A table of options with price, best for, limits, source date |
| Quantified claim | "In our analysis of 1,200 invoices (January to June 2026), the median payment delay was 23 days." |
| Step answer | Numbered steps with the outcome of each |
| Expert view | "'We stopped using X because...' says [name], [role] at [company]." |

## Original data: the most valuable asset
Surveys, anonymised product data, price indexes and benchmark tests are cited by journalists, communities and AI answers alike. Plan one substantial dataset per quarter, publish the method, and update it on a schedule.

## Worked example
A cybersecurity vendor's "what is phishing-resistant MFA" guide ranked fifth but was never cited. Cited competitors had a crisp definition, a comparison table of methods and recent attack data. The rewrite added a 60-word definition under the first heading, a table comparing passkeys, FIDO2 keys, push and SMS with phishing resistance and cost, results from the vendor's own phishing simulation of 3,000 employees (with method), and a quote from its head of research. Within two months the page was cited in Perplexity and AI Overviews for definition and comparison prompts.

## Output format
```
# Answer-readiness review: <URL>, <date>
## Prompts and sub-queries the page should answer
## Cited competitors and what they offer
## Findings
| Section | Issue (commodity, no answer, no evidence, outdated) | Fix |
## Rewritten answer passages
## Evidence to add (owner)
## Re-check date
```

## Edge cases and judgement calls
| Situation | What to do |
|---|---|
| No original data available | Use first-hand experience: worked examples, tests, screenshots, decisions and their outcomes |
| Commodity topic everyone covers | Find the angle only you have: your market, customers, numbers or method |
| Product pages | Make facts explicit: prices, limits, compatibility, policies, in text and tables |
| Pages that must stay short | One strong answer passage and one table beat padding |
| Engines cite an outdated version of your page | Update the facts, add a dated change note and check for duplicates still indexed |
| Competitor page is cited for your brand facts | Publish a clear, current fact page and link it from your About and product pages |

## Answer passage checklist
- Starts by naming the subject.
- Gives the answer in the first sentence.
- Adds one fact, number or condition that makes it specific.
- Makes sense if read alone, without the rest of the page.
- Stays under about 80 words; detail follows below.

## Handoffs to related skills
- Choosing the questions: `query-fan-out-mapping`
- Checking Google citations: `ai-overviews-ai-mode`
- Brand attribution: `entity-optimisation`
- Getting original data covered: `ai-citation-earning`
- Writing quality and trust: the Content SEO `seo-content-writing` and `eeat-content-quality` skills

## Quality bar: what an excellent rewrite includes
- An original element in every key section.
- Direct answers under question headings.
- Every figure sourced and dated.
- No myths sold as tactics.

## Common mistakes
- Splitting pages into tiny fragments because someone said AI likes chunks.
- Adding FAQ blocks of generic questions nobody asks.
- Statistics with no source or date.
- Burying the answer under background.
- Publishing AI-written summaries of other people's content.

## Questions to ask before you rewrite
- What can this business say that nobody else can?
- Which facts must never be wrong in an AI answer?
- Who can supply data and expert input?

## Self-check before you answer
- Does each key section contain an original element or a clear answer?
- Is every figure sourced and dated?
- Did I avoid myths (chunking, special markup, llms.txt) as ranking levers?
- Would a reader find the page satisfying without AI in mind?
